# RStudio Cheat Sheets 

This is a collection of R, Git and other interesting things cheat sheets that I've downloaded mainly from the [RStudio site][] although some of them are form other sources. 

I keep this mainly a repository for me, but perhaps it's useful for someone so I'll keep it open. 

Last time [RStudio site][] was checked for new sheet was: **2019-06-01**

Checked means that I have it printed. You can check what I have pending [2Print](2Print.md).
